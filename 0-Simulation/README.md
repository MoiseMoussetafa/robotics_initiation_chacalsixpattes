# Simulation
A simple simulation based on PyBullet.

# Requirements
Tested on Python 3.6 but should work on any recent version of Python :
```bash
pip3 install numpy pygame pybullet onshape-to-robot transforms3d scipy
```

# Usage
There are several simulation files but generaly ```python3 sim_hexa.py -h``` gives some info on how to use them.
Make sure the file ```kinematics.py``` is in this folder.
```bash
python3 sim2.py --mode direct
```
```bash
python3 sim2.py --mode inverse
```
```bash
python3 sim2.py --mode circle
```
```bash
python3 sim2.py --mode triangle
```
```bash
python3 sim_hexa -m ultrawalk
```
```bash
python3 sim_hexa -m walk
```
```bash
python3 sim_hexa -m rotation
```
```bash
python3 sim_hexa -m inverse-all
```
```bash
python3 sim_hexa -m inverse
```
```bash
python3 sim_hexa -m robot-ik
```
